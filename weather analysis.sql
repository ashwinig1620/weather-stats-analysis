# 1 Create a table "STATION" to store information about weather observation stations:

CREATE TABLE STATION 
(ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CITY CHAR(20),
    STATE CHAR(2),
    LAT_N REAL,
    LONG_W REAL);


# 2 Insert the following records into the table:

INSERT INTO STATION VALUES (13,'PHOENIX','AZ',33,112);
INSERT INTO STATION VALUES (44,'DENVER','CO',40,105);
INSERT INTO STATION VALUES (66,'CARIBOU','ME',47,68);


# 3 Execute a query to look at the table STATION in undefined order:

select* from STATION;


# 4 Execute a query to select Northern stations (Northern latitude > 39.7):

SELECT * FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 39.7;

# 5 Create another table, 'STATS', to store normalized temperature and preciptation data:

CREATE TABLE STATS
(ID INT REFERENCES STATION (ID),
    MONTH INT CHECK (MONTH BETWEEN 1 AND 12),
    TEMP_F REAL CHECK (TEMP_F BETWEEN -80 AND 150),
    RAIN_I REAL CHECK (RAIN_I BETWEEN 0 AND 100),
    PRIMARY KEY (ID,MONTH));


# 6  Populate the table STATS with some statistics for january and july:

INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (13, 1, 57.4, 0.31);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (13, 7, 91.7, 5.15);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (44, 1, 27.3, 0.18);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (44, 7, 74.8, 2.11);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (66, 1, 6.7, 2.10);
INSERT INTO STATS VALUES (66, 7, 65.8, 4.52);

SELECT * FROM STATS;


# 7 Execute a query to display temperature stats (from stats table) for each city (from station table):

SELECT CITY, TEMP_F FROM STATION
    INNER JOIN STATS
    ON STATS.ID = STATION.ID
    ORDER BY CITY;


# 8 Execute a query to look at the table STATS, ordered by month and greatest rainfall, with columns rearranged. It should also show the corresponding cities:

SELECT MONTH, RAIN_I, CITY 
FROM STATS  
JOIN STATION 
ON STATS.ID = STATION.ID 
ORDER BY MONTH, RAIN_I DESC;


# 9 Execute a query to look at temperatures for July from table STATS, lowest temperatures first, picking up city name and latitude.

SELECT LAT_N, CITY, TEMP_F FROM STATS, STATION
WHERE MONTH = 7
AND STATS.ID = STATION.ID
ORDER BY TEMP_F;

# 10 Execute a query to show MAX and MIN temperatures as well as average rainfall for each city :

SELECT CITY, MAX(TEMP_F), MIN(TEMP_F), AVG(RAIN_I)  FROM STATS
INNER JOIN STATION 
    ON STATS.ID = STATION.ID
    GROUP BY CITY;


# 11 Execute a query to display each cityâ€™s monthly temperature in Celcius and rainfall in Centimeter:

CREATE VIEW METRIC_STATS ( CITY, MONTH, TEMP_C, RAIN_C) AS SELECT CITY, MONTH,
    (TEMP_F -32)* 5/9 , RAIN_I * 2.54 FROM STATS
	INNER JOIN STATION 
    ON STATS.ID = STATION.ID;
    
SELECT * FROM METRIC_STATS;


# 12 Update all rows of table STATS to compensate for faulty rain gauges known to read 0.01 inches low:

UPDATE STATS
SET RAIN_I = RAIN_I + 0.01;



SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;


SELECT * FROM STATS;

#13. Update Denver's July temperature reading as 74.9:
UPDATE STATS SET TEMP_F = 74.9
WHERE ID = 44
AND MONTH = 7;

SELECT * FROM STATS;
